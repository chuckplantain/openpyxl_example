# Using openpyxl to look at cells in an excel spreadsheet.

One problem is that Libre Office spreadsheets fail to report row counts, and
column counts...

so, this example does create a standard 1024 rows. But, Excel saved spreadsheets report
accurate row and column counts enabling for an accuarte for-loop.

Using Openpyxl 2.2.6 leaves the styling intact while editing the text! Earlier
Versions fail to do so.
